# KiasuDash: Gamification & Race Mechanics

## 1. The Point Economy (Simplified)

To maintain high engagement for Primary students, the economy is centered around a single, easy-to-understand currency.

- **Primary Currency: Dash Coins**
  - **Earning:** Students earn coins for every correct answer. Bonus coins are awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishes in a room.
  - **Utility:** Coins are spent in the **Dash Shop** to unlock Avatar Skins (e.g., Robot Scholar, Lightning Fox) and "Dash Trails" (visual effects that follow the player during a race).
- **Collection Goal: Subject Badges**
  - Students collect four core badges: **Math Magnet**, **Word Wizard**, **Science Star**, and **Lingua Legend**.
  - Collecting all four unlocks the temporary **"Kiasu King/Queen"** crown for the week.

## 2. In-Race Progress Visualization

The traditional progress bar is replaced with a **Dynamic Race Track** to provide instant feedback and psychological excitement.

- **The Heat Map Track:**
  - Every participant is represented by their chosen Avatar on a horizontal racing lane.
  - **Ghosting:** Players see faint icons of competitors near them to create a sense of physical proximity and "chase."
- **The "Overtake" Mechanic:**
  - When a player passes another on the track, a subtle "Overtaken!" alert appears on the opponent’s screen, encouraging them to speed up.
- **The Finish Line Trigger:**
  - When the leader reaches the end, a **"Final Dash"** 10-second countdown begins for all other players to maximize their score before the room closes.

## 3. The "Kiasu" Win-Streak System

The win-streak is a real-time visual "engine" that displays a player's momentum during the challenge.

| Streak Level   | Visual State      | In-Race Effect                                                            |
| :------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **3 Correct**  | **Blue Smoke**    | Avatar starts emitting smoke; movement on track smooths out.              |
| **5 Correct**  | **On Fire 🔥**    | Avatar catches fire. A "Combo" sound effect plays.                        |
| **8+ Correct** | **Nitro Mode ⚡** | Screen edges glow with motion blur; maximum Dash Coins earned per answer. |

## 4. Competitive Leaderboards

- **The Weekly Podium:** A "Top 100" list that resets every Monday morning (Singapore Time).
- **Fresh Starts:** The reset ensures that the competition remains accessible and prevents "Top Player Stagnation," giving every student a weekly chance to see their name on the board.
- **Status Indicators:** A player's current rank determines the "Glow" of their nameplate in Public and Private rooms.
