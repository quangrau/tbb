## 3. Key Mechanics: The "Dash Rooms"

Unlike traditional quizzes, KiasuDash focuses on simultaneous racing.

Room Creation: Users (students or teachers) can host Public or Private rooms.

Capacity: Supports 1v1 duels up to large-scale classroom "Grand Prix" races.

Privacy Control: Private rooms use a "Room Code" system (similar to Kahoot) for safe, invitation-only play.

Race Format: Everyone starts at once. A progress bar shows how far "ahead" or "behind" each student is in real-time as they answer questions.

## 4. Gamification & Competition

Race Against Time: Speed is the primary multiplier for points.

Collection Points: Students earn "Dash Credits" to unlock cosmetics or power-ups.

Global Leaderboard: Ranks students based on their performance across all public rooms and duels.

## 5. Market Positioning

Local Edge: Uses the "Kiasu" branding to tap into the Singaporean competitive spirit.

Professional Quality: Modern, sleek UI (Electric Blue/Cyber Purple) to ensure it feels like a premium educational tool rather than a niche hobby.
